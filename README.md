# Project-2: 📊 Twitter Sentiment Analysis
This project analyzes sentiment from **Twitter data** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. The goal is to classify tweets as **Positive, Negative, or Neutral** and visualize sentiment trends.

# 🚀 Features
- **Sentiment Classification** – Analyzes tweets to determine sentiment polarity (**Positive, Negative, Neutral**).
- **Text Preprocessing** – Cleans text by removing stopwords, punctuation, URLs, and special characters.
- **Data Visualization** – Generates sentiment distribution charts, word clouds, and insights.
- **Scalable & Efficient** – Handles large datasets efficiently with **Pandas and NumPy**.

# 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** – Core programming language for sentiment analysis.
- **NLTK** – Used for Natural Language Processing (NLP) and sentiment classification.
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Handles data processing and transformations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Visualizes sentiment distribution with charts and graphs.
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive analysis and exploration.

# 📊 Sentiment Analysis Workflow
- **Data Collection** – Load tweet datasets for analysis.
- **Text Preprocessing** – Clean text, remove noise, and tokenize words.
- **Sentiment Analysis** – Use NLP techniques to classify sentiment.
- **Data Visualization** – Generate sentiment distribution charts.
- **Insights & Interpretation** – Extract useful patterns from data.

# 🔮 Future Improvements
- Enhance sentiment accuracy using BERT / Vader / LSTM models.
